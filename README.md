# CurrencyConverterStatic
Base static value application using WPF app, XAML and C#

NOTE -> The master branch is the base application which uses static (hard coded) currency data. To test the concept and get familiar with a currentcy converter using WPF app, XAML and C#.

The final version uses a SQL database to store and gather currency conversion rates and currency names.
Found on the newest branch -> CurrencyConverterUsingSQL_Database

There is more to come with this, such as updating the regex expression to allow a more precise input of money, for example $132,198.48
Where as right now the program will only accept numbers and no decimals.

May convert this to a Xamaran app in the future if there is time. 

Will also make this able to gather info from a web api to get live currency values from the web.

sorry for the short readme will update with more information when possible.
